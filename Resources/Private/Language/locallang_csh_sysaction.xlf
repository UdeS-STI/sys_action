				<source>Currently an Action may be configured to create additional backend usergroups without being and admin-user and by selecting from a limited set of options. Another option is to let an action initiate a SQL SELECT-query in the database and return the result as a CSV file.
Actions can be assigned to a Backend usergroup and they are activated by a single click in the Task Center.</source>
